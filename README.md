# Chip8-interpreter
First attempt at a Chip8 Emulator. Using Cow God and Austin Morlan's documentation as guide.

*** Learning Goals:

	* Better understand low level architecture (RAM, ROM, Regesters ... ext)
	* Learn how to use SLD
	* Improve writing and reading C++ code

*** Gains:



*** Next Steps:

I followed Austin Morlan's documentation too closely for this project. While helpful in introdcing me to the world of emulators In the future I might
create another chip8 interpreter using the std::library. For example while I see the apeal in using a function table i feel like it would be more efficient to use
an unordered map instead of an array.

I might also jump into a larger project like creating a gameboy emulator.
